下面的合约就十分的复杂, 但是的确是展现出了`Solidity`的许多特性. 它实现了一个投票的合约. 当然, 电子投票的主要的问题, 如何给正确的人分配投票权和如何阻止暗箱操作. 在这里我们并不会解决所有的问题, 但是 至少我们将展现如何进行一场**自动化记票和完全透明**的委托投票

主要的思路是是对每次投票创建一个合约, 对每个选项提供一个短的名称. 合约的创建者 就作为这次投票的主持人(chairperson)将会给与其他独立地址的投票权利

这些账户(可投票)的拥有者可以自己投这一票, 或者把自己的票委托(delegate)给他们信任的人.

在这次投票结束的时候, `winningProposal()` (function)将会返回这个票数最多的人

Possible Improvements
=====================

Currently, many transactions are needed to assign the rights
to vote to all participants. Can you think of a better way?

*************
秘密竞价（盲拍）
*************

In this section, we will show how easy it is to create a
completely blind auction contract on Ethereum.
We will start with an open auction where everyone
can see the bids that are made and then extend this
contract into a blind auction where it is not
possible to see the actual bid until the bidding
period ends.

.. _simple_auction:

Simple Open Auction
===================

The general idea of the following simple auction contract
is that everyone can send their bids during
a bidding period. The bids already include sending
money / ether in order to bind the bidders to their
bid. If the highest bid is raised, the previously
highest bidder gets her money back.
After the end of the bidding period, the
contract has to be called manually for the
beneficiary to receive his money - contracts cannot
activate themselves.

Blind Auction
=============

The previous open auction is extended to a blind auction
in the following. The advantage of a blind auction is
that there is no time pressure towards the end of
the bidding period. Creating a blind auction on a
transparent computing platform might sound like a
contradiction, but cryptography comes to the rescue.

During the **bidding period**, a bidder does not
actually send her bid, but only a hashed version of it.
Since it is currently considered practically impossible
to find two (sufficiently long) values whose hash
values are equal, the bidder commits to the bid by that.
After the end of the bidding period, the bidders have
to reveal their bids: They send their values
unencrypted and the contract checks that the hash value
is the same as the one provided during the bidding period.

Another challenge is how to make the auction
**binding and blind** at the same time: The only way to
prevent the bidder from just not sending the money
after he won the auction is to make her send it
together with the bid. Since value transfers cannot
be blinded in Ethereum, anyone can see the value.

The following contract solves this problem by
accepting any value that is larger than the highest
bid. Since this can of course only be checked during
the reveal phase, some bids might be **invalid**, and
this is on purpose (it even provides an explicit
flag to place invalid bids with high value transfers):
Bidders can confuse competition by placing several
high or low invalid bids.
